PHZ was added to the fish water of the treated group for 30 min every 3 days for 5 weeks. The 30 min incubation with PHZ was followed by a 30 min wash in fish water. PHZ was used at a concentration of 1.25 μg/mL the first week followed by 2.5 μg/mL for the rest of the protocol. The control group followed the same process without the addition of PHZ in the fish water.

PHZ was added to the fish water of the treated group for 30 min every 3 days for 5 weeks. The 30 min incubation with PHZ was followed by a 30 min wash in fish water. PHZ was used at a concentration of 1.25 μg/mL the first week followed by 2.5 μg/mL for the rest of the protocol. The control group followed the same process without the addition of PHZ in the fish water.

PHZ was added to the fish water of the treated group for 30 min every 3 days for 5 weeks. The 30 min incubation with PHZ was followed by a 30 min wash in fish water. PHZ was used at a concentration of 1.25 μg/mL the first week followed by 2.5 μg/mL for the rest of the protocol. The control group followed the same process without the addition of PHZ in the fish water.

    <Title>Gene expression data from the heart during regeneration in a zebrafish model of heart failure</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE120962</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>32835855</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Heart Failure (HF) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally. Novel therapeutic targets to tackle this pandemic are in dire need. Zebrafish, a vertebrate whose heart shares many physiological similarities to the human heart, are able to naturally undergo cardiac regeneration following HF.
We used microarrays to analyse gene expression during cardiac regeneration following heart failure
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Heart failure was induced in adult zebrafish using phenylhydrazine (PHZ, anaemia inducer) treatment for 5 weeks followed by a regeneration period of 9 days without PHZ. Whole-genome microarray analysis was performed in heart samples at the end of the PHZ treatment and at different time-points thereafter (2, 5 and 9 days after PHZ treatment discontinuation). Gene regulation patterns were characterized using bioinformatics.
