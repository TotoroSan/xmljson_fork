Sequence information for this array was selected from the following public data sources: RefSeq (July 2003), GenBank (release 136.0, June 2003), dbEST (July 2003), and UniGene (Build 54, June 2003). Probe sets on the array were designed with 16 oligonucleotide pairs to detect each transcript.This array was designed in collaboration with representative members of the Zebrafish community and the National Institutes of Health.Note: The DsRed probe set is provided with permission from BD Biosciences, and BD Biosciences grants users a limited license to utilize this probe set only on the Affymetrix array. Other uses of the probe set, or other DsRed sequence or sequences requires a license from BD Biosciences.Annotations derived from Affymetrix CSV file dated 6/23/2004    </Description><Web-Link>http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=zebrafish</Web-Link><Web-Link>http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx</Web-Link><Relation type="Alternative to" target="GPL24541" comment="alternative CDF [Zebrafish_Dr_ENTREZG, Brainarray version 14.0.0]" /><Data-Table><Column position="1"><Name>ID</Name><Description>Affymetrix Probe Set ID </Description><Link-Prefix>https://www.affymetrix.com/LinkServlet?probeset=</Link-Prefix></Column><Column position="2"><Name>GB_ACC</Name><Description>GenBank Accession Number </Description><Link-Prefix>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=</Link-Prefix></Column><Column position="3"><Name>SPOT_ID</Name><Description>Column added by GEO staff to facilitate sequence tracking in Entrez GEO</Description></Column><Column position="4"><Name>Species Scientific Name</Name><Description>The genus and species of the organism represented by the probe set.</Description></Column><Column position="5"><Name>Annotation Date</Name><Description>The date that the annotations for this probe array were last updated.

We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.    </Summary><Overall-Design>Zebrafish embryos were selected at successive stages of early development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We selected embryos exposed to 20 ug/L pentachlorophenol (C1), 50 ug/L pentachlorophenol (C2),  and deionized water control (C3) at the gastrula stage (about 8hpf).    </Overall-Design><Type>Expression profiling by array</Type><Contributor-Ref ref="contrib1" position="1" /><Contributor-Ref ref="contrib3" position="2" /><Contact-Ref ref="contrib1" /><Sample-Ref ref="GSM908630" /><Sample-Ref ref="GSM908631" /><Sample-Ref ref="GSM908632" /><Sample-Ref ref="GSM908633" /><Sample-Ref ref="GSM908634" /><Sample-Ref ref="GSM908635" /><Sample-Ref ref="GSM908636" /><Sample-Ref ref="GSM908637" /><Sample-Ref ref="GSM908638" /><Supplementary-Data type="TAR">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE37nnn/GSE37019/suppl/GSE37019_RAW.tar    </Supplementary-Data><Relation type="BioProject" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA157525" /></Series></MINiML>
